# GemsCrush

Gems Crush is a simplified version of the classic tile-matching puzzle video game, Bejeweled. User can swap one gem with an adjacent gem to form a horizontal or vertical
chain of three or more gems in the same color. Gems disappear when chains are formed and gems fall from the top to fill in gaps.
